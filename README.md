### Blender & Python
Q1.1: Blender provides an API that can be interacted with using Python. How can you use Python scripting to automate the creation of a 3D model in Blender? Please provide a basic code example.

Q1.2: In Blender's Python API, what is the purpose of the bpy module? How can you use it to manipulate object transformations in a 3D scene?

### Python & Docker
Q2.1: Describe the steps to create a Docker container for a Python-based application. What information would you need to include in the Dockerfile?

Q2.2: Explain how you can use Docker Compose to manage multi-container Python applications.

### JavaScript 3D (Three.js)
Q3.1: Describe the fundamental components needed to render a basic 3D scene using Three.js.

Q3.2: How can you import and use a 3D model created in Blender within a Three.js application?

### Blender, Python, JavaScript 3D & Docker
Q4.1 Revised: Imagine you're creating a pipeline to automatically generate 3D models in Blender using Python scripts. Then, you will display these models on a web interface served by Flask. Finally, the whole application runs in a Docker environment. How would you structure this pipeline?

Q4.2: What challenges might you face when developing and deploying this kind of application, and how would you tackle them?

### Docker & JavaScript 3D
Q5.1: How would you containerize a Node.js application serving a web-based 3D viewer powered by Three.js?

Q5.2: What kind of considerations would you need to keep in mind when deploying this Docker container in a production environment?
